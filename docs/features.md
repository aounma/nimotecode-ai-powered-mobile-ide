# NimoteCode Features

NimoteCode keeps the essential development loop in one mobile workspace: **Explorer → Editor → Preview → Terminal → Git → AI**. Choose only the tools a task needs, while keeping the project context intact.

## Core workspace

| Module | What it helps you do | Access |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Explorer + SSH | Open a local project or connect to a saved remote SSH workspace with password or key authentication. | Free |

## New in 1.1.5

The current release makes more of the development loop visible without leaving the workspace: preview local or remote web projects in-app, keep two files open side by side, inspect images and play supported media, and follow active Agent work across panels. It also improves SSH connection reuse, mobile terminal input, Git refresh and diff rendering, long-session resource use, and interface consistency. See the [release notes](/releases/) for the complete change list.

## A practical way to use the features

1. Connect through [SSH Workspace](/docs/ssh), or open a local project.
2. Locate and edit the file in [Editor](/docs/editor).
3. Verify it in [Terminal](/docs/terminal); search output or remote content when needed.
4. Ask [AI Chat and Agent](/docs/ai) to explain an error or plan a change.
5. Use [Source Control](/docs/source-control) to review the result; Pro is required when the delivery step needs a gated Git write action.

> Features are deliberately permission- and environment-aware. For example, LSP and Debug depend on the language server or debug adapter being set up on the remote host, and AI output should be reviewed before use on sensitive systems.
